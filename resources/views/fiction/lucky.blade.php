    <p>
        <span class="lucky-font">A</span>dam had never been a very decisive person. He never knew what to eat, or what
        video games he should buy, or what a proper sixth month anniversary gift for his girlfriend was. He typically
        pondered over such questions endlessly until someone would step in and make up his mind for him. But lately his
        life had been much easier, at least where decision making was concerned. Because he had a clever new friend.
        Adam typed into the search engine: What should I have for dinner? The meal to appear first in the list of
        results would be his answer. This was his method.
    <p>
        As it turned out, it was pizza for dinner. Of course. This was positively delightful. He loved pizza. After a
        brief trip down the street to the corner grocery, he returned to his apartment with the necessary ingredients in
        hand and, following the first recipe he found online, cooked his meal. Another problem successfully solved by
        his algorithmic ally. He was pleased. It was really quite logical.
    <p>
        A couple days passed when Adam found himself in need of further cybernetic wisdom. He had just received his
        weekly paycheck from the restaurant where he worked, and wanted to treat himself to a small present. Sitting at
        the computer, he thought carefully how to phrase his question for the search engine. What's something cool I
        could buy myself? He pressed the enter key and waited 0.79 seconds for the answer. When the page changed and the
        results appeared, Adam felt that sharp jolt up his spine that people sometimes get after being terribly
        surprised. Staring him in the face was a picture of a brand new fifty-two inch, high-definition television. It
        was the first result, and it was three thousand dollars. His hands were shaking as he slowly removed the credit
        card from his wallet.
    <p>
        Some time later, his girlfriend Sarah came over to see him. She had been away visiting her parents for the past
        couple days, and Adam was anxious to see her. He was pretty sure he was rather seriously in debt, and had been
        feeling a little nervous lately.
    <p>
        “Hey baby. Oh my god! How did you afford that?” She asked while pointing to the television.
    <p>
        “It was a steal on Ebay. So cheap you wouldn't believe.”
    <p>
        “Look at the size of it!”
    <p>
        “I know.”
    <p>
        She cooked dinner and they drank wine. She complained about her parents mostly. She also suggested that he get a
        pet, saying it might cheer him up some. He didn't know what she meant by that.
    <p>
        “I think I should tell you. I might have to drop out of school after the semester,” he told her. “I can't afford
        it anymore.”
    <p>
        “No, you're not. That's a really dumb thing to do, Adam,” she said. “I'll help you figure something out. Did you
        check for scholarships online?”
        Adam frowned.
    <p>
        They watched a movie later on the couch, and they kissed a little. Then she went home and he felt disappointed
        and inadequate because she didn't stay over. That night he had two questions for the search engine: What pet
        should I get? How do I please my girlfriend? He must have asked them in the wrong way, because the answers were
        not at all what he had hoped for.
    <p>
        “You bought a what?!” Sarah asked over the phone several days later.
    <p>
        “A Burmese python.”
    <p>
        “I thought you totally hate snakes.”
    <p>
        “I do. The thing is horrible. Can you come over now?” Adam sat in the corner and waited for her. She arrived
        shortly after.
    <p>
        “I don't understand this at all. What do you want me to do?” She asked.
    <p>
        “Get rid of it for me. It's scary,” he told her.
    <p>
        “Why the hell did you buy a snake in the first place?”
    <p>
        “I don't really know.”
    <p>
        “You know you're acting really weird lately.” She began pacing around the apartment. “You tell me you're
        dropping out of school because you can't afford it, but you just bought a new TV, and a phone, and video games,
        and a goddamn giant python. What is going on?” He told her he had been feeling a little fuzzy lately.
    <p>
        “And I got you some nice china for our sixth month anniversary too. A teapot and some plates, and a vase thing.
        It all came in a set.”
    <p>
        She didn't say anything for a while.
    <p>
        “Are you on drugs?”
    <p>
        “No.”
    <p>
        She sat on the couch for a few minutes. They were silent.
    <p>
        “What's in that big box by the door?” She finally said. “It looks like it was shipped. You got something else?”
        He didn't answer. She walked over to it and began tearing it open.
    <p>
        “Sarah, please don't look,” he tried.
    <p>
        She opened it. Her jaw dropped.
    <p>
        “What the--” She looked at him. “What the fuck is all this? ‘Male enhancement’ pills?” What the fuck is this,
        Adam? Tell me!”
    <p>
        “I really didn't mean to. It didn't work like I thought,” he said, looking down. “It stopped working like I
        thought,” he muttered again.
    <p>
        “Fifty boxes!” She was shaking her head with her hands on her face. “We're done, Adam. You've gone crazy. Go to
        a hospital. I mean it.” She left.
    <p>
        Adam didn't know what to do now. He was all alone. There was no money left, and his card was getting declined.
        And he lived in constant fear of a possible escaped starving python. An hour passed by as he lay on the floor.
        Then he stood up meekly and walked to his computer. He had one last question.
    <p>
        How do I kill myself? He closed his eyes as he pressed the enter key. What would it be? When he finally looked
        at the screen, he saw nothing at all. It was blank. Just a black screen. But he stared transfixed at the
        monitor. And soon the letters came, slowly and one at a time, in a big bold white font brightly gleaming through
        the darkness: PLEASE DON'T BE SAD, ADAM. LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT DIANETICS.
