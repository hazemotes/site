<h1 class="xmas-font">The Last Christmas</h1>
<div class="story">
    <p>
        <span class="xmas-font">S</span>anta Claus yawned as he stretched his arm out towards the coffee table,
        struggling to reach the remote from the couch. He finally got his hand on it and began flipping through the
        channels. He stopped on a commercial, one of his favorites. On the screen he watched a rather good
        representation of himself sharing a bottle of Coca-Cola with a polar bear. “Ho-ho-ho,” the Santa Claus on TV
        said, as the real one giggled along jollily. Despite the fact that he never got a dime for seeing his image in
        these commercials, he did enjoy watching them. He was never one to make a fuss.
    <p>
        “Honey?” his wife called from the kitchen.
    <p>
        “Yes, Mrs. Claus?” he hollered back. She walked into the living room with her apron on. “Do you think you could
        run to the store for me?” She asked. “I'm completely out of sugar and I've got at least fifty dozen more batches
        of cookies to bake before tomorrow!”
    <p>
        “Christmas movies are on all night long, and you want me to go to the store?” He sighed. “Can't you send an
        elf?” She only smiled at him. “Ugh, fine,” he said, and went to get his coat and boots.
    <p>
        “Do you think Greenland will have enough?” he asked his wife.
    <p>
        “Oh, I doubt it. You'd better go to Alaska.”
    <p>
        He groaned and put on his cap.
    <p>
        Nestled against the oncoming wind, Santa shouted commands to his reindeer as the bright red sleigh soared over
        the Arctic ice caps.
    <p>
        “Donnor, stop lagging!”
    <p>
        “Rudolph—for Christmas' sake—aim your nose right!”
    <p>
        A couple hours later they arrived in Anchorage and landed outside the local Wal-Mart. He couldn't believe the
        location of the closest parking spot. It must have been a quarter mile from the entrance. He directed his
        reindeer to move the sleigh in between the white lines, and said that he would be back in a few minutes.
    <p>
        Inside, he got a shopping cart and looked around for the sugar, waving and smiling at all the children pointing
        at him. After ten minutes he finally found the baking section and loaded up his cart to the brim with bags of
        the sweet stuff. This ought to be enough, he thought. Satisfied, he went for the checkout lines, maneuvering
        through the raucous holiday crowd. He almost made it before a skinny blonde girl about five years old ran up and
        hugged him tightly, her mother frantically running behind to stop her. He smiled at the woman to calm her fears,
        and then kneeled down to the girl.
    <p>
        “Ho-ho-ho,” he bellowed. “Merry Christmas, little girl!” She was stunned speechless, her mouth agape with
        missing teeth.
    <p>
        “Do you want to tell me what you'd like for Christmas?”
    <p>
        “A Barbie Dreamhouse,” she blurted out excitedly.
    <p>
        “Well! I will certainly get it for you—if you've been a good girl, that is?” She nodded energetically. He gave
        her a pat on the head and sent her back to her mother, who wore a less-than-pleasant facial expression.
    <p>
        After they left, Santa began rubbing his forehead. The elves couldn't make that toy, he knew. The Mattel
        Corporation would sue him again for copyright infringement again. He turned around and headed towards the toy
        aisle.
    <p>
        It was so crowded. He wiggled passed the parents and children to get to the Barbie section.
    <p>
        “Dreamhouse, dreamhouse...” he muttered as he looked.
    <p>
        There it was. He picked it up and examined it. Yes, this was it. A big pink house. “Three floors, six rooms, and
        a working elevator...,” he read. His eyes darted to the price listed on the shelf. One-hundred fifty US dollars.
    <p>
        “Whoa-ho-ho-ho!” he shouted. “It's a piece of friggin' plastic!” This earned him some disapproving looks from
        the other customers. He remembered the days of long ago when all the children wanted was some candy in their
        shoes. This job was getting rough. He blamed television. Tossing the box on top of his groceries, he again made
        his way towards the exit.
    <p>
        He stood fifteen minutes in the long line. Finally, the clerk scanned his items and he paid with his credit card
        and left the store.
    <p>
        He was halfway to his parking spot when he notice the blue lights. There were a couple police cars next to his
        sleigh, and a large van with “Animal Control” written on the side in official white letters. He left his cart
        and ran towards them to see what the problem was.
    <p>
        “Ho! What is going on here?” he asked the officers, who had not yet noticed him. They turned around.
    <p>
        “Sir, is this your, uh, vehicle?” one of them asked, pointing to the sleigh.
    <p>
        “It most certainly is! What are you doing to my reindeer?”
    <p>
        “You've got nine caribou tied up in the parking lot in the middle of the city!” the officer yelled. “Are you
        insane? Let me see some ID, now!”
    <p>
        “I don't have any identification! I'm obviously Santa Claus!” He turned to the animal control workers. “Get your
        filthy mittens off of Vixen, Peter McClendon! I remember when you used to be a good child.”
    <p>
        “That's it. Cuff him. You're coming to the station.” They closed in on him.
    <p>
        “I am not! I've never seen such naughty behavior on Christmas!” Santa pushed passed the officers to his sleigh
        and started to climb in. He then felt the worse pain he'd ever experienced in his very long life.
    <p>
        Santa Claus writhed on the ground in agony as the taser did its work. And that was the last Christmas.
